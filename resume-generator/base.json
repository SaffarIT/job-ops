I\u2019m comfortable using Python for scripting, data cleaning, and small backend services, and I have academic experience with SQL from my databases module, which I\u2019ve applied in analytics-focused side projects. I\u2019m particularly interested in AI-driven systems and would be excited to help develop and improve AI agents for marketing and user acquisition while working closely with data scientists, engineers, and marketing/product teams</p></blockquote>"
